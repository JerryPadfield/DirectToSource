Participant Information Sheet

<h3>Fresh Sources: Broadening Participation in Community Radio
</h3><p>
You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact me if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.
</p>
<h3>What is the purpose of this study?</h3><p>
The purpose of this study is to provide useful information for community radio stations about ways in which they can encourage participation from members of currently under-represented groups. To do so I will be collaborating with people from groups including the over 60s, people in rural areas, women and people with disabilities in order to make radio/broadcast content.
</p><h3>
Why have you been chosen?</h3><p>
You have been chosen to take part in this study because you accessed the Direct to Source website.
</p>
<h3>Do I have to take part?</h3><p>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason. 
</p><h3>
What will happen to me if I take part?</h3><p>
You will send in some recorded audio.</p>
<h3>
What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3><p>
You will need to give up some time to create the audio.
</p>
<h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3><p>
You may find the project interesting and enjoy creating the audio. You may enjoy hearing your content used as part of a radio show. Once the study is finished it could provide information useful to other community radio stations about how to better reflect the community in the make-up of station’s volunteers.
</p>
